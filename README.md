# Virgin Interest Finder

This repository contains two versions of the Virgin Interest Finder application:

1. **Mobile Version** - A Tinder-like swiping interface for mobile devices
2. **Desktop Version** - A grid-based, clickable interface optimized for desktop use

Both apps help users discover Virgin initiatives that match their sustainability interests.

## Mobile Version

Located in the `mobile-chat-app` directory, this version features:

- Mobile-optimized UI with Tinder-like swipe gestures
- Single interest selection per card (swipe right to like, left to dislike)
- Responsive design that simulates a mobile device
- Swipe animations and visual feedback

To run the mobile version:

```bash
cd mobile-chat-app
npm install
npm start
```

## Desktop Version

Located in the `desktop-interest-finder` directory, this version features:

- Desktop-optimized UI with a grid layout
- Multi-select functionality (click to select multiple interests)
- Larger screen space utilization
- More detailed results display

To run the desktop version:

```bash
cd desktop-interest-finder
npm install
npm start
```

## How Both Apps Work

Both apps share the same core functionality:

1. Present users with a selection of sustainability topics
2. Allow users to indicate their interests
3. Match those interests with relevant Virgin initiatives
4. Show the top matching initiatives
5. Provide details about why each initiative matched

The main differences are in the user interface and interaction patterns, optimized for different device types.
